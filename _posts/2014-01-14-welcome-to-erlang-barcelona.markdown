title:  To everyone interested in Erlang in Barcelona!"
---

As of now there is a new meetup in Barcelona:
[Erlang-Barcelona](http://www.meetup.com/Erlang-Barcelona/).

{% highlight erlang %}
start() ->
    spawn(fun() ->
                  "Erlang-Barcelona"
          end).
{% endhighlight %}

I hope the meetup will become a great place to learn, teach and
discuss Erlang as well as a great platform to get to know friendly
techies with similar interests.

About two and a half year ago, when I was living in Zurich, I founded
the
[Zurich Erlang User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-Erlang-User-Group/),
basically because I at that time didn't know any Erlang developers in
Zurich, and hoped that being a meetup coordinator, would give me lots
of opportunities to learn about Erlang from others.

I was right - and in many ways, The Zurich Erlang User Group turned
out a lot better than I could have hoped for. It became a friendly and
open platform where anyone who wanted to contribute could do so in a
very informal and positive atmosphere. From the beginning we
encouraged people to do presentations, even if they had never done a
presentation before in their lives. It also didn't matter how obscure
or super specific the topic, or if the topic was dealing with the
intricacies of a framework, or was about a hobby or a work project. As
long as it was in some way related to Erlang.

So I am really excited about the Erlang-Barcelona meetups and I hope
you are too. And of course, if you live in Barcelona or are here for a
visit and want to learn about Erlang, please join us!

Cheers,
Lars
