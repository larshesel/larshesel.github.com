title:  "Inaugural Erlang Barcelona meetup"
---

Yesterday we held the first
[Erlang-Barcelona](http://www.meetup.com/Erlang-Barcelona/) meetup at
the [Redbooth](http://redbooth.com/) offices.

It was great to see that so many decided to show up and connect with
the Erlang community. I think we're off to a great start!

As promised, here's a link to the talk I gave yesterday:
[Introducing Erlang](http://larshesel.dk/talks/20140212-introducing_erlang/).

Hope to see you all again next time!

Cheers,
Lars
